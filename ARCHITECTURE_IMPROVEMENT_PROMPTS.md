# Architecture Improvement Prompts for EC2/RDS Migration

## ðŸŽ¯ **High Priority Code Changes**

### **PROMPT 1: State Management Standardization**
**Context**: Currently mixing Riverpod and Provider packages, causing inconsistent state management patterns.

**Implementation Task**: 
> "Refactor the Flutter app to use only Riverpod for state management. Remove the Provider package dependency and convert `OfflineCalendarProvider` (and any other ChangeNotifier classes) to Riverpod StateNotifier. Create a centralized dependency injection container using Riverpod providers for all services (ApiService, SQLiteHelper, OfflineDataService). Ensure all providers are properly scoped and follow the Riverpod best practices."

**Files to Change**:
- `lib/main.dart` (remove Provider wrapper)
- `lib/features/calendar/events/offline_calendar_provider.dart` â†’ Convert to StateNotifier
- Create `lib/core/providers/app_providers.dart` for centralized DI
- All feature providers to use consistent patterns

**Expected Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for state
- Better performance with fine-grained rebuilds
- Easier testing and debugging

---

### **PROMPT 2: Enhanced Offline-First Architecture**
**Context**: Current offline sync is complex with dual logic in main.dart and OfflineDataService. No proper conflict resolution.

**Implementation Task**:
> "Redesign the offline-first architecture to be more robust. Create a unified sync manager that handles all offline/online operations. Implement proper conflict resolution strategies (last-write-wins, user-choice, automatic merge). Add clear UI indicators for sync status, offline mode, and sync conflicts. Create a background sync queue that intelligently batches operations and handles retry logic. Add comprehensive sync state management with user-friendly error recovery."

**Files to Change**:
- Create `lib/core/sync/sync_manager.dart`
- Refactor `lib/shared/services/offline_data_service.dart`
- Clean up sync logic in `lib/main.dart`
- Add sync UI widgets in `lib/shared/widgets/`
- Implement conflict resolution dialogs

**Expected Benefits**:
- Reliable data synchronization
- Better user experience during network issues
- Clear feedback on sync status

### **PROMPT 3: API Service with Circuit Breaker & Retry Logic**
**Context**: Current API service lacks retry logic, circuit breaker patterns, and proper error classification.

**Implementation Task**:
> "Modernize the ApiService class to implement enterprise-grade reliability patterns. Add exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures, implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures, add request/response interceptors for logging and metrics collection. Create proper error classification (network, server, client, business logic errors) with appropriate handling strategies. Add timeout configurations per endpoint type and implement request deduplication for idempotent operations."

**Files to Change**:
- Refactor `lib/data/api_service.dart`
- Create `lib/core/network/` directory with:
  - `circuit_breaker.dart`
  - `retry_policy.dart`
  - `request_interceptor.dart`
  - `error_classifier.dart`
- Update all API calls to use new patterns

**Expected Benefits**:
- Better resilience to network issues
- Improved debugging with request logging
- Reduced server load with intelligent retries

### **PROMPT 4: Repository Pattern Implementation**
**Context**: Direct database access from UI layers and no abstraction between data sources.

**Implementation Task**:
> "Implement the Repository pattern to create a clean abstraction layer between the UI and data sources. Create repository interfaces for each data type (EmotionalRecord, BreathingSession, etc.) with implementations that intelligently choose between local SQLite, remote API, and cache. Add automatic fallback mechanisms when one data source fails. Implement intelligent caching strategies with TTL and cache invalidation. Remove all direct SQLiteHelper and ApiService calls from UI layers."

**Files to Create**:
- `lib/core/repositories/` directory with:
  - `base_repository.dart` (interface)
  - `emotional_record_repository.dart`
  - `breathing_session_repository.dart`
  - `user_repository.dart`
- `lib/core/cache/` directory for caching logic

**Files to Change**:
- All providers and services to use repositories
- Remove direct database access from UI

**Expected Benefits**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easier testing with mock repositories
- Consistent data access patterns
